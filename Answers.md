1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An *adaptive website* possesses distinct layouts for multiple specified screen sizes while a *fully responsive website* combines the features of an adaptive website and a fluid website to show content based on the available browser space by changing its arrangement and size dynamically to fit the browser window.


2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Mobile first involves designing and optimising a web page for mobile functionality first, before designing it for desktop (usually through the inclusion of additional features at higher resolutions). Modern mobile first designs often include stacked layouts due to screen size constraints. 

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

62.5% is a common hack used by web developers so that rem units are easy to calculate. It makes the default font size for your webpage 10px (62.5% of 16px, 
the default font size of most browsers), so that when values are represented in rem relative to that, it's easier to scale things proportionately across the page. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

CSS preprocessing is basically the use of a program that generates plain CSS from a preprocessed language/unique syntax (by a process known as compiling) which allows the developer to add some features that don't exist in pure CSS. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept in preprocessing is nesting due to the fact that it brings a high level of readability even as a project that involves a great deal of styling gets bigger.  Out of all the features that I have read up on so far, scoping in less (as well as combining it with other features in more advanced ways) has proven to be the most evasive  on first look.
